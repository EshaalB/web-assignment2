# Question 4 Part B: Conceptual Question

### 1. The difference between Float, Flexbox, and Grid
- **Float**: Designed for text wrapping; requires manual clears. 1D layout.
- **Flexbox**: Ideal for 1D alignment (rows or columns). Handles dynamic sizes easily.
- **Grid**: A true 2D system. Controls rows and columns simultaneously for complex layouts.

### 2. When to use each
- **Float**: Use for simple text wrapping around images.
- **Flexbox**: Use for components, navbars, and centering items.
- **Grid**: Use for main page structures and overlapping elements.

### 3. Best for modern design
**CSS Grid** is best because it reduces code complexity for responsive layouts. It offers more precision and flexibility than older methods.
